*********** ORM ***********
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. 
This allows developers to work with database data as if they were regular objects in their programming language, simplifying database interactions and improving productivity.

//****************** Error: Could not execute because the specified command or file was not found ******************//
This error occurs when the .NET CLI cannot find a command or executable you tried to run, such as dotnet-ef. The full message usually looks like:
Could not execute because the specified command or file was not found. Possible reasons for this include:
- You misspelled a built-in dotnet command.
- You intended to execute a .NET program, but dotnet-ef does not exist.
- You intended to run a global tool, but a dotnet-prefixed executable with this name could not be found on the PATH.
To resolve this error, you can try the following steps:
1. Check for Typos: Ensure that you have spelled the command correctly. For example, if you meant to run the Entity Framework Core command-line tool, make sure you typed dotnet ef instead of dotnet-ef.
2. Install the Required Tool: If you intended to run a global tool, make sure it is installed. For example, to install the Entity Framework Core CLI tools, you can run:
   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
3. Verify PATH Environment Variable: Ensure that the directory where global tools are installed is included in your system's PATH environment variable. You can check this by running:
   echo $PATH   (on macOS/Linux)
   echo %PATH%  (on Windows)
4. Restore Project Dependencies: If you are trying to run a command related to a specific project, make sure to restore the project's dependencies by running:
   dotnet restore
5. Check .NET SDK Installation: Ensure that you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can verify this by running:
   dotnet --version
6. Update .NET SDK: If you have an older version of the .NET SDK, consider updating to the latest version, as some commands may not be available in older versions.
If you continue to experience issues after trying these steps, consider consulting the official .NET documentation or seeking help from the .NET community.

OR
Make sure u downloaded the Entity Framework Core tools (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore) via NuGet Package Manager or .NET CLI with the correct version compatible with your project.

//****************** IActionResult ***********//
IActionResult is an interface in ASP.NET Core MVC that represents the result of an action method. 
It is used to define various types of responses that an action can return, such as views, JSON data, redirects, or status codes.
By returning an IActionResult, developers can have more flexibility in controlling the HTTP response sent to the client.
//****************** IActionResult ***********//

//****************** Task<IActionResult> ***********//
Task<IActionResult> is an asynchronous version of IActionResult used in ASP.NET Core MVC action methods.
When an action method returns Task<IActionResult>, it allows for asynchronous operations, such as database calls or external API requests, to be performed without blocking the main thread.
This improves the scalability and responsiveness of web applications by freeing up resources while waiting for I/O-bound operations to complete.
//****************** Task<IActionResult> ***********//


//****************** AsNoTracking ***********//
AsNoTracking is a method in Entity Framework Core that allows you to query data without tracking the returned entities in the DbContext's change tracker.
When you use AsNoTracking, the entities retrieved from the database are not monitored for changes, which can improve performance for read-only operations where you don't need to update the entities later.

//****************** DTOs ***********//
DTOs, or Data Transfer Objects, are simple objects used to transfer data between different layers or components of an application.
They typically contain only data and no business logic, making them lightweight and easy to serialize.
DTOs are often used to encapsulate data for communication between a client and server, or between different parts of an application, 
helping to reduce the amount of data sent over the network and improve performance.
//****************** DTOs ***********//

//******************      ***********//
return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetStok), new { Id = stockDto.ToStockFromCreateDTO().Id }, stockDto.ToStockFromCreateDTO());

//****************** Middleware ***********//
Middleware is software that sits between the operating system and applications, providing common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system.
In the context of web development, middleware refers to components that process HTTP requests and responses in a web application pipeline.
Middleware components can perform various tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and request modification before passing the request to the next component in the pipeline or returning a response to the client.

//****************** Dependency Injection (DI) ***********//
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement Inversion of Control (IoC) in software development.
It allows a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. This promotes loose coupling, easier testing, and better maintainability of code.
In DI, dependencies are typically provided through constructor injection, property injection, or method injection. A DI container is often used to manage the lifecycle and resolution of dependencies.
